# Technical Documentation Page

This project is a Technical Documentation Page created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. The Technical Documentation Page provides comprehensive information on various technical topics and fulfills the following user stories and guidelines:

- You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc," which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

- Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There are a minimum of five sections.

- The first element within each .main-section is a header element, containing text that describes the topic of that section.

- Each section element with the class of main-section has an id that corresponds to the text of each header contained within it. Spaces in the headers are replaced with underscores (e.g., The section with the header "JavaScript and Java" has a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

- The .main-section elements contain at least ten p elements in total (not each).

- The .main-section elements contain at least five code elements in total (not each).

- The .main-section elements contain at least five li items in total (not each).

- You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar."

- The navbar element contains one header element that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

- Additionally, the navbar contains link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There is one for every element with the class main-section.

- The header element in the #navbar comes before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

- Each element with the class of nav-link contains text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g., if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar has an element with the text "Hello world").

- When you click on a navbar element, the page navigates to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g., If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world," the page navigates to a section element with that id and contains the corresponding header).

- On regular-sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" is shown on the left side of the screen and is always visible to the user.

- Your technical documentation uses at least one media query.
